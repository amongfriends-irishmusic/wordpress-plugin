/* Support for clearing Gutenberg left floats. Using this stylesheet increases
 * latency and therefore should be avoided if possible. It exists to avoid
 * having to manually add custom CSS to new themes. The Among Friends Gutenberg
 * theme already includes this clearfix, so it doesn't need to be loaded for
 * that particular theme. See also:
 * https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4127
